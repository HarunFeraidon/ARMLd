# Augmented Reality Machine Learning d (Armold)

This is the "Cool Team"'s (of the Adaptive Decision Systems Lab, Systems Engineering, University of Virginia) 
cool machine learning and augmented reality project. Everything in this repo (as of June 2018) is only related
to the Machine Learning part of the project. AR code will be added eventually.
