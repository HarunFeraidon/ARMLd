Currently relies on OpenAI gym, my VM is Windows 10 which is not supported, used this command:
pip install --no-index -f https://github.com/Kojoley/atari-py/releases atari_py

Adapted code from Python 2 to Python 3.5 

Things to do: 
-Change environment from OpenAI gym to our own Pong or PongRivanna implementation
-Write method in Pong or PongRivanna that returns raw pixels of state [figure out matrix/list/hash]
